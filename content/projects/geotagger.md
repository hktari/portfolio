# Geotagger
Made as part of the skillup mentor course. An app where users browser and add to a collection of locations. Each location has an image and an address.

The challenge is to guess the correct address based on the image of the location.


The app features a leaderboard, a map and geocoding service using OSM and image storage using AWS.

The frontend is deployed on netlify.
