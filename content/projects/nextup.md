# Nextup
Made as part of the skillup mentor course. Users are able to create, book and browse events. An event has a maximum attendee count. 
When a user books he / she takes up a slot.

The app features:
- user account management
- auth guarded event CRUD operations
- image upload using AWS S3
- location autocomplete using OpenStreetMaps
- email reminders and password reset using SendGrid
- CI/CD using git actions and AWS ECS
- statically rendered event detail pages using next.js
