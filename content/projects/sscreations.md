# ss-creations

Sara Skorjanc's website offers life coaching focused on personal development, spiritual awakening, and self-improvement.

She wanted a platform to market her services in a way that would filter out non-serious customers and allow only specific customers to contact her. The applications process for her personal development courses consists of a questionaire, a payment integration (via Stripe) and finally e-mail notification.

Furthermore, every service has a maximum number of applicants, that when reached disables new applications.

As a starting out business she wanted a way to gather future customers and perform e-mail marketing afterwards. This is powered via Sendgrid signup forms, e-mail designer and contact lists allowing.

A CMS allows for easy editing of the website

tech stack:

- Gatsby hosted on Netlify
  - Bootstrap
- Strapi (CMS) hosted on Railway
- Stripe
- Sendgrid
