## A website built in Wix for the Dog Hotel Habitat located in Billje, Croatia
    
available under https://www.habitat.com.hr/ or https://renatazilic.wixsite.com/website/

The website has been built during my stay volunteer stay in the dog hotel. I've been there for a month. Walking, feeding dogs and cleaning the place clean.

It has been very giving experience, during which I also got to design and create this awesome website for them.

It is made in Wix and the logos, images and text have been supplied by the owner the dog hotel.
